### **_Description_**

#### Are you terrifed to take LinkedIn Skill Assessments due to the fact you only get two tries to pass? Well, no more! I created a quiz app that has the exact bank of questions from those skill assessments. Take them as many times as you want to prepare! If you use this app, please share it on your social media as a thank you! Responsive to ALL SCREEN SIZES!
